# PointMatter-Automation-Testing-Internship-report

INTERNSHIP ACTIVITIES

TRAINING
During the course of the internship, we have received training on various software testing technologies 
and tools.
This included the theoretical concepts of “What is Software Testing?”, “Manual Testing”, “Automation 
Testing” and “Types of Automation Testing”.
Further we were provided with training on Automation Testing Tools namely “TestLink”, “Selenium”, 
“Protractor”, “Jasmine Reporter”, “Jenkins”.
Selenium and Protractor scripts were initially written and tested on Login Pages of ‘Facebook’, 
‘Twitter’, ‘Instagram’, ‘LinkedIn’, ‘Yahoo Mail’, ‘Times Job’ and ‘Naukri’.
Writing scripts for various types of websites gave us an exposure on how to write the automation 
testing scripts as well as connecting them to tools like Testlink and Jenkins to view the reports 
generated eased us while doing the same with the actual “PointMatter SaaS project”.

ROLE IN APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
My role during the summer internship at LogicMatter was ‘Software Tester’ for their current on-site 
project titled “PointMatter SaaS”. During the period of 30 days, I tested various components of the 
project for bugs using Selenium Testing and Protractor while generating reports through TestLink as 
well as Jasmine Reporter and submitting the same to the higher authorities.
Although the internship was performed as a group of four, all four of us were given the same work as 
Software Tester as we are new to automation testing and everyone will gain enough practice on the 
concepts.
